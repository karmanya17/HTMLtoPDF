# HTMLtoPDF
This application runs on Node.js and Converts a HTML file to PDF and image. 
I am using two npm libraries html-pdf and node-html-to-image for PDF and Image conversion.
For parsing the HTML element from the file I used node-html-parser.
Also added the upload functionality, which allow us to upload a file eg. my_receipt.html and parse it for converting it to PDF and Image.
It saves the converted PDF and Images in the output folder.
